# GPIO One

GPIO One is an unofficial user-created set of modules to allow you to
easily use various input/output devices on your Raspberry Pi when the
default library and GPIOzero don't have any useful code.

It currently provides interfaces to:

* Ultrasonic Distance measuring devices.
* LCD Displays such as the 1602A
* Shift registers such as 74HC595
* Seven Segement LED displays
* Three colored RGB Leds.

It was primarily written to help the author learn more about
interfacing various hardware with the Raspberry Pi. I have made
attempts to write clear, easy-to-follow code that should be generally
reusable. How useful this is to anyone else remains to be seen. Let me
know if you find it helpful!
